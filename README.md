# Hunter Clash

A turn-based mobile (portrait) hunt-and-push strategy game for the web. Blue (you) vs Red (computer).

Each turn has two states:

1. **Hunt** – the card panel slides away; drag in the strip under your castle to pull back, then release. Every arrow you own flies down that line together, side by side with a small gap between them. Each is spent on the first animal it hits; it bounces off the field edge once and breaks on the next edge it meets. When the volley lands, each of your squads strikes whatever is in reach, steps forward if the way is clear, and strikes again where it stops.
2. **Spend** – each turn deals you four different cards out of six. Drag one onto the board and its slot is refilled at once with a card you are not holding, so you can keep playing for as long as the meat lasts:
   - **Warriors**, **Archers**, **Giant** – onto either road.
   - **Tower** – onto a checkpoint you hold.
   - **+1 Arrow**, **+Damage** – onto your own castle.

The deal is random but weighted. Early on it is mostly Warriors, Archers and the two upgrades. Giants and Towers become common from about turn 6, and an upgrade turns up less the more of it you own (+1 Arrow is rare once you have three). Any card can still appear on any turn, and every fresh hand has Warriors or Archers in it. Refills are drawn with the same odds. The odds are the `DEAL` table in `js/config.js`.

## Hunting

The herd is small, about six animals. A kill comes back two rounds later.

- **Quick prey** (rabbit, deer, stag; gold number) dies to any hit and pays its whole bounty at once. It keeps to the middle of the field, far from both castles, and moves fast. Arrows are slow by comparison and the aim preview does not lead for you, so you have to shoot at where the animal will be.
- **Slow prey** (sheep, cow, bull, bear, dino) pays a share of its bounty per hit, in proportion to hunting damage, and takes several hits. The cheapest kinds graze nearest the castles; richer ones roam further out.
- Nothing ever stands still.
- Richer prey arrives every 5 turns: cow on 6, bull and deer on 11, bear on 16, dino and stag on 21.

**+1 Arrow** adds an arrow to every volley, widening it: more ground covered against quick prey, and several arrows landing on the same slow animal each do their damage. **+Damage** adds 2 hunting damage (you start on 5), so slow prey pays more per hit. Before you shoot, the DMG badge beside your nocked arrows shows the volley's total damage: arrows times hunting damage. Both upgrades get dearer each time you buy them. Meat spent here is meat not spent on troops, so a greedy hunter can be rushed.

## Troops

| | What it is for | Weakness |
|---|---|---|
| **Warriors** | The all-round fighter: 36 health, fells warriors or giants in two blows | None in particular |
| **Archers** | Hit 2 slots ahead, so they add damage from behind a front-liner | Die to a single blow from any squad |
| **Giant** | Breaking guard towers: 2 blows | Slower and dearer than warriors, and no better in a fight |
| **Tower** | Blocks the road. Warriors and archers together need 6 blows to break it | Giants |

Nothing hits further than 2 slots, towers and castle guards included, so only the front of a column fights. Archers stop as soon as an enemy is in range. A column sorts itself as it marches: giants lead, warriors follow, archers bring up the rear. A giant or warrior moving up swaps places with any lower-ranked friend in its way, pushing them back a slot; that uses up its normal step, it gets no extra movement for it. A squad strikes whenever a step ends with an enemy in reach, including the free step it takes when you place it.

## Lanes

Each road is a row of 25 slots with 5 checkpoints, 4 open slots between neighbours. The slot beside each castle is that team's home slot: nobody else may stand there, so you can always deploy at your own gate.

Checkpoints belong to whoever's front line has reached them, and troops can be dropped on any free slot from your gate up to the furthest checkpoint you hold. Lose the units holding the line and the checkpoints go with them.

A castle has 100 health and its own guards, who shoot whatever reaches the gate. Pushes are meant to arrive, land a hit or two and die, so keep sending waves. An arrow that reaches the enemy castle only chips 1 off it. The lanes decide the match.

Matches are capped at 25 turns. If both castles are still standing it goes on points: your castle's remaining health plus all the damage your side has dealt to enemy troops, towers and castle (the star in the HUD). So the side that did the fighting still wins. Level points go to checkpoints held, then meat.

## Opponents

Noob, Recruit, Veteran, Ace and Legend, picked on the menu before a match. They differ only in how well they aim and think; every unit stat and price is the same for both sides. A fresh page load always starts on Noob, whose first turn shows a drag-to-aim demo.

All numbers (unit stats, prices, prey, AI levels) live in `js/config.js`.

## Run locally

No build step. The game uses ES modules, so it needs to be served over HTTP:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8123
```

Then open <http://localhost:8123>.

## Deploy to GitHub Pages

Push to `main`, then in the repository go to **Settings → Pages → Build and deployment**, choose **Deploy from a branch**, and select `main` / `(root)`.
